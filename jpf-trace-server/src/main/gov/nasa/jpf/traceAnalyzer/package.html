<title>gov.nasa.jpf.traceAnalyzer package</title>
</head>
<body>
Provides classes for trace analysis.

<p>Trace analyzers use trace queries (see {@link gov.nasa.jpf.traceServer.traceQuery.TraceQuery})
for querying the trace database. They process those information and generate a number of reports as a result. 
Report generation can be an integral part of the analyzer or analyzer 
may use the services of a printer or printers from the {@link gov.nasa.jpf.traceServer.printer} package.
Analyzer can be launched at the end of JPF search (the only solution for the in-memory trace storer, 
see {@link gov.nasa.jpf.traceServer.traceStorer.inMemory.InMemoryTraceStorer InMemoryTraceStorer})
or may be running as a standalone application.
</p>

<p>This package contains implementation of several trace analyzers: for analyzing sequences of method calls, 
for looking for overlapping method calls on the same object from different threads and 
for searching for deadlock by observing thread interaction.
</p>

<p>New analyzers that will be part of the Trace Server, will be added to this package, 
but third party analyzers can be placed anywhere.
