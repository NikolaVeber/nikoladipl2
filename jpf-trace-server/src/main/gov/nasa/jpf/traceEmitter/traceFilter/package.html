<body>
Provides classes for filtering events emitted by {@link gov.nasa.jpf.traceEmitter.TraceEmitter trace emitters}.

<p>Enables you to use the same trace emitter and store different set of trace data (or different level of details)
from various trace server runs.
</p>

<p>A filter is capable of forwarding events in the same way they are received. It can then act as an emitter to
another trace filter, or a trace storer, allowing pipelining multiple trace storers.
</p>

<p>
This makes trace analysis looks like this:<br/><br/>
<nobr><i>JPF + emitter -> trace filter(s) -> ... -> trace filter(s)-> trace storer(s) -> DB -> query -> analyzer</i></nobr>
<br/><br/>

With this setup, events could be multiplexed to the in-memory database, 
or the Neo4J version or even sent over the wire by using the remote storer. 
(see {@link gov.nasa.jpf.traceEmitter.traceFilter.GeneralTailTraceFilter}).
</p>

<p>
TraceFilter is implemented as a Chain of Responsibility design pattern, and has one major limitation:
it is the responsibility of a trace filter to forward data. If the filter forget to forward data, the chain breaks, events are lost.
Furthermore, a trace filter may listen to multiple events before deciding on whether to forward events or not.
It is up to the creator of the filter to decide about this.
